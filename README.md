# Steam Description

[h1]Zemia[/h1]
Zemia is a fantasy setting in which we have played various D&D campaigns. The aim of this mod is to import this setting to EU4, combining our passion for both. Although there isn't much to see at the moment (we spend a *significant* amount of the modathon getting the map to work), more content has already been written and will be added after the modathon concludes, with the potential for regular updates if people are interested!
